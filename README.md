## Episode Breakdown

### 1. [DeepSeek Series Introduction](https://youtu.be/QWNxQIq0hMo)
An overview of what this 20-part series covers and why DeepSeek is an important architecture to study in the LLM space.

### 2. [DeepSeek Basics](https://youtu.be/WjhDDeZ7DvM)
Introductory concepts required to understand how DeepSeek builds on top of transformer-based LLMs.

### 3. [Journey of a Token into the LLM Architecture](https://youtu.be/rkEYwH4UGa4)
Walkthrough of how a token flows through the layers of a transformer — from embedding to logits.

### 4. [Attention Mechanism Explained in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/K45ze9Yd5UE)
A full-length deep dive into attention mechanisms, with whiteboard-style explanations and examples.

### 5. [Self Attention Mechanism – Handwritten from Scratch](https://youtu.be/s8mskq-nzec)
Manual derivation of self-attention mechanics with intuitive step-by-step math and code.

### 6. [Causal Attention Explained: Don’t Peek into the Future](https://youtu.be/c6Kkj6iLeBg)
Explains masked attention in autoregressive models to prevent tokens from accessing future context.

### 7. [Multi-Head Attention Visually Explained](https://youtu.be/qbN4ulK-bZA)
An animated, visual breakdown of multi-head attention and why it improves learning.

### 8. [Multi-Head Attention – Handwritten from Scratch](https://youtu.be/rvsEW-EsD-Y)
A code-first approach to implementing multi-head attention manually in Python.

### 9. [Key-Value Cache from Scratch](https://youtu.be/IDwTiS4_bKo)
Covers efficient caching of key-value pairs during inference to optimize decoding in LLMs.

### 10. [Multi-Query Attention Explained](https://youtu.be/Z6B51Odtn-Y)
Details how Multi-Query Attention reduces memory usage and is used in inference-optimized LLMs.

### 11. [Understand Grouped Query Attention (GQA)](https://youtu.be/kx3rETIxo4Q)
Explains how GQA blends the benefits of MHA and MQA and is used in models like LLaMA and DeepSeek.

### 12. [Multi-Head Latent Attention From Scratch](https://youtu.be/NlDQUj1olXM)
Introduces the novel **MLA** mechanism used by DeepSeek and builds the theory from first principles.

### 13. [Multi-Head Latent Attention – Code Implementation in Python](https://youtu.be/mIaWmJVrMpc)
Full Python implementation of MLA, helping you understand how latent attention is computed and used.

### 14. [Integer and Binary Positional Encodings](https://youtu.be/rP0CoTxe5gU)
Introduces alternative encodings to sinusoidal and rotary for positional awareness.

### 15. [All About Sinusoidal Positional Encodings](https://youtu.be/bQCQ7VO-TWU)
The classic encoding strategy used in the original Transformer paper — explained in full detail.

### 16. [Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE)](https://youtu.be/a17DlNxkv2k)
Understanding how RoPE works, its mathematical foundation, and how it enables relative positioning.

### 17. [How DeepSeek Implemented Latent Attention | MLA + RoPE](https://youtu.be/m1x8vA_Tscc)
Real-world implementation breakdown of how DeepSeek combines MLA with Rotary Encoding.

### 18. [Mixture of Experts (MoE) – Introduction](https://youtu.be/v7U21meXd6Y)
Theoretical introduction to MoE, explaining why sparse expert routing boosts model capacity.

### 19. [Mixture of Experts – Hands-On Demonstration](https://youtu.be/yw6fpYPJ7PI)
